										“Making it as real as if you had been there, Paul Alexander has done an
										incomparable
										job bringing to life both elements of his title. He shows us the malice and
										ignorance of Billie’s accusers and eventual killers, the love and support of

										the
										immortal Lady Day.”

									<blockquote style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; color: #000000;">
										“Perhaps only in this century can we fully change the narrative of
										Billie Holiday. Billie was a trespasser of taboos, a woman of tenderness
										and
										terror, whose story is repeated again and again by working-class women
										of
										color. This is a heartfelt ballad of a book written as only one artist
										could
										view another, with insight and sincere compassion.”
